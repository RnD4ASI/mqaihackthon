Regulatory Reporting Use Cases\\n    Busniess Analyst provided an overview of the regulatory reporting requirements and the critical use cases to ensure compliance.\\n    Mark Davis emphasized the necessity to meet all regulatory standards to maintain transparency and avoid penalties.\\nEmma Wilson discussed the current reporting processes within the Finance Department and highlighted some areas needing improvement.\\n2. Access, Permissions, and Approvals\\nBusniess Analyst outlined the need for different levels of access and permissions to manage reports effectively:\\n\\nAdmin Access: Full control over report creation, editing, and user permissions management.\\nReviewer Access: Permission to review and approve reports without editing capabilities.\\nViewer Access: Read-only access for viewing reports without making changes.\\nMark Davis suggested implementing a role-based access control (RBAC) system to streamline the management of permissions and ensure security.\\n\\nEmma Wilson agreed on the need for a clear approval workflow to ensure timely and accurate report reviews.\\n\\n3. Data Preparation Process\\nEmma Wilson described the current data preparation process:\\n\\nData Collection: Gathering data from various sources.\\nData Cleansing: Removing duplicates and correcting inaccuracies.\\nData Transformation: Formatting data to meet regulatory reporting standards.\\nBusniess Analyst recommended adopting ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools to automate data preparation and improve efficiency.\\n\\nMark Davis highlighted the importance of maintaining data integrity throughout the preparation process.\\n\\n4. Data Retention Period Discussion\\nMark Davis outlined regulatory requirements for data retention, emphasizing compliance with legal mandates.\\n\\nEmma Wilson discussed the business requirements for retaining financial data for internal analysis and audits.\\n\\nDiscussion Points:\\n\\nRegulatory Compliance: Ensuring data is retained for the legally required period (e.g., 7 years).\\nBusiness Needs: Retaining data beyond regulatory requirements for historical analysis and trend reporting.\\nData Archiving: Implementing a data archiving solution to manage and access older data efficiently.\\nBusniess Analyst proposed developing a comprehensive data retention policy that balances regulatory and business needs, including:\\n\\nDefining retention periods for different types of data.\\nEstablishing procedures for archiving and purging data.\\nEnsuring secure storage and easy retrieval of archived data.\\nAction Items:\\nBusniess Analyst: Draft detailed use cases and requirements for regulatory reporting.\\nMark Davis: Compile and share regulatory requirements for data retention with the team.\\nEmma Wilson: Provide detailed documentation of the current data preparation process.\\n Busniess Analyst: Create a draft data retention policy for review by all stakeholders.\",\n",
